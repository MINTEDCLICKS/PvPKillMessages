made by minty#4097. sets custom kill message on kill in the format §c{$playerkilledname} §7was killed by §a{$killername} §7[§a{$killerhealth}§7] 

this format can be changed however i have set no config files so you must go into the main.php and change line 24. if you are unable to do this you are braindead.

you may also use this for to include items such as pots with a little tweaking.

if you have a plugin which sets player health upon a kill then this may break this plugin as the health shown will not be accurate to the health that was at the time of the kill.

if you want to use a plugin which does set player health upon kill then you must use a plugin with a delay. one of these plugins is https://github.com/MINTEDCLICKS/HealthOnKill

this plugin is for PM4.
